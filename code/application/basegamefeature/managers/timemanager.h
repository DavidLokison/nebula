/**
    Game::TimeManager

    Singleton object which manages the current game time. These are
    the standard time source objects provided by Application layer:

    TIMESOURCE_SYSTEM   - timing for low level Application layer subsystems
    TIMESOURCE_GAMEPLAY - timing for the game logic
    TIMESOURCE_INPUT    - extra time source for input handling
    
    Each time source tracks its own time independently from the other
    time sources, they can also be paused and unpaused independentlty 
    from each other, and they may also run faster or slower then
    realtime. 

    You can create custom time sources by using the create interface.
